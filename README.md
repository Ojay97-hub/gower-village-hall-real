## Key Features

- Responsive public website covering hall hire, events, blog content, churches, committee information, businesses, and contact details.
- Public booking flow with calendar visibility for confirmed bookings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables:

   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL="..."
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."
   VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="..."
   VITE_MASTER_ADMIN_EMAILS="name@example.com"

   BREVO_SMTP_USER="..."
   BREVO_SMTP_PASS="..."
   BREVO_FROM_EMAIL="..."
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL="..."

   BREVO_API_KEY="..."
   BREVO_HALL_LIST_ID="..."
   BREVO_CHURCHES_LIST_ID="..."
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Testing

The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library. The current suite contains 34 tests across 6 files.

### Run the tests

```bash
npx vitest run
npx vitest
```

### Current Coverage Areas

| Test file | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/escapeHtml.test.ts` | 7 | HTML escaping behaviour used in email content |
| `tests/auth.logic.test.ts` | 11 | Master admin detection and role-gating logic |
| `tests/AdminRoute.test.tsx` | 5 | Protected route behaviour for role-based admin access |
| `tests/MasterAdminRoute.test.tsx` | 3 | Master admin route protection |
| `tests/send-booking.test.js` | 6 | Validation rules for the booking API handler |
| `tests/send-newsletter.test.js` | 2 | Validation rules for the newsletter API handler |

Note: the production email-sending path relies on Nodemailer in the API handlers, so email delivery itself should be verified with end-to-end testing against a deployed environment.
